Catchment for myth for
Truncated history
Stickleback
Western pond turtles
Tend the water
The invisible creeks
Coming home
Coming up
Can hear the echoes from MacArthur tunnel
The aerators in the water
From this bench
50 some years in this city and I've never seen a bat here
Was that a bat?
Bug catching over the lake
Tend the water
Raise the water
And you may see the old things
Come again
