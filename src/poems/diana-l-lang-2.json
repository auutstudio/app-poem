  "body": "Wandering the city of my dreams,\nwith my grandfather’s spirit in my mind,\naccompanying me into old fashioned arcades,\nstaring across the bay and sending love to friends who sail it.\n\nWe wander around on this merry go round of love,\nfinding the candy stores of our souls.\nI dined on a heart attack between buns,\nI longed for slower times,\nand I received them.\n\nThe man behind the bush no longer causes me to jump,\nI gladly ask strangers for photos,\nI connect with traveling Texans.\nand a man said, “You’re a steam punk”\nwhen here I was thinking of hippies.\n\nThis life is a candy store,\nbut it takes trying new things\nto figure out what’s sweetest,\nand sometimes all you find\nis that the marzipan still ain’t your bag.",
